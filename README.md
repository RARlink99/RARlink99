- 👋 Hi, I’m @RARlink99
- 👀 I’m interested in ... dotProject
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn how to upgrade from version 2.1.5 to a version compatible with PhP 7.4
- 💞️ I’m looking for help in upgrading dotProject in cpanel or using cpanel
- 📫 How to reach me ... rarlink99@gmail.com or txt 6608514291
dotProject version 2.1.5 was installed on duratech-services.com almost 10 years. They run their business from dotProject.
I am now retired and need help to get them to a version that will work with php version 7.4. I am willing to pay for the support. Would like help with the steps to upgrade.
Thank you
